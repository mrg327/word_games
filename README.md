# Word Game Solver

This project is a script that solves a 2D word game. The game is played on a square grid of letters, and the goal is to find words in the grid. Words can be found by starting at any letter and moving to adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to form a word. Words must be at least three letters long, may not wrap around the edges of the grid, and may not reuse any letters.
